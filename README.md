# Athena - AI-Powered Educational Task Management Web App

Athena is an AI-powered educational task management web app designed to help students track, manage, and prioritize their tasks efficiently. Athena imports and organizes assignments by connecting to third-party educational platforms, breaking them down into manageable subtasks with priority scores calculated in the backend.

## Features

### Pseudo-Login Page
- **Test Data for Users**: We generated test data for prototype users.
- **Login System**: Matches the user's username; it's not secure and meant only for prototyping.
- **Automatic User Creation**: If you log in with a non-existent username, it creates one automatically.

### Task Management
- **Three Columns for Tasks**: Tasks can be dragged and dropped between columns.
- **Task Creation Methods**:
  - **Import All Assignments**: Import all assignments from the third-party education platform.
  - **Import Selected Assignments**: Import specific assignments from the third-party education platform.
  - **Manual Task Creation**: Manually add tasks for assignments on other platforms.

### Task Details and Management
- **Expanded Task View**: 
  - View details like due date, weight, description, estimated time, and priority score.
  - View and manage subtasks generated by the GPT API, with a progress bar to track completion.
- **Delete Task**: Remove tasks as needed.
- **Filter Options**: Filter tasks in each column to prioritize them according to your preferences.

## Note

Due to the cost of using the ChatGPT API, I cannot host this project live. However, you can see a functional demonstration of the app in this [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16uKAHajKWCFvbDYS2jdxQRt0MElgyZYd/view?usp=sharing).
